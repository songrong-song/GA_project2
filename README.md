When I open the application, I should see a map displayed.
The map should be centered on a specific location (latitude: 1.290270, longitude: 103.851959) and have a zoom level of 12.
There should be markers on the map representing different locations.
Each marker should have a icon
When I click on a marker, an info window should appear displaying the name of the project.
The info window should have a "Close" button to close it.
The map should have a toggle button to switch between different map types (roadmap, terrain, satellite, hybrid).
When I click on the "Transaction" link in the info window, I should be navigated to a separate page (Details.js) showing more detailed information about the selected marker.
The navigation bar should be displayed at the top of the page with the title "Singapore Property Transaction Record" and a "Back To Home" link.
